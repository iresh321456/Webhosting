        <p>Our first stop is Yala, the most famous national park in Sri Lanka. Its fame is largely thanks to the fact that Yala has the most densely populated leopard presence on earth. Around 40 leopards are believed to roam the area, but sightings of these elusive creatures are still very rare.</p>

        <li>Venue3:Kumana national park</li>
        <p>Wilpattu, Sri Lanka’s biggest national park, is located in the north-west lowlands and was once the most famous place for seeing leopards in the country.Leopard sightings have been more common recently and it’s slightly less busy than Yala. The same wildlife roam Wilpattu as at Yala and the animals are slightly less cautious of humans. </p>

        <h1>habitat loss and defragmentation</h1>
        <p>Habitat loss and fragmentation is a major threat to the survival of the Sri Lankan leopard. As human settlements expand, the leopard’s natural habitat is increasingly encroached upon, leading to a decrease in their population5.
            Conservation Efforts: Organizations like Leopocon Sri Lanka are working towards the conservation of Sri Lankan leopards and their ecosystems. They aim to raise awareness, conduct research, and safeguard the country’s apex predator</p>

        <h1>Poaching</h1>
        <img src="./images/Poaching leopards.jpeg" />
        <p>Poaching is another significant threat to the Sri Lankan leopard. Their coats are in high demand, which has led to an increase in illegal hunting activities5.

            Conservation Efforts: The Wilderness and Wildlife Conservation Trust (WWCT) conducts ecological research and raises awareness to help maintain a peaceful human-leopard dynamic and to preserve the habitat in which the leopard can thrive</p>
